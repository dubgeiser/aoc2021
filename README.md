# Advent Of Code 2021

My solutions for the Advent Of Code 2021.

This is my first time doing such a thing, it's challenging enough, so I'm not going to make my life near impossible by experimenting with different languages, or other personal challenges, so just using Python in a "if it works, it works" kinda mindset.

Code is up for grabs, public domain.
