# Exercises I might come back to later

Numbers surrounded with `!!!` _really_ should be revisited because of stupid/naive/inefficient algorithm.
Otherwise, it might just be considered "nice to try something different"

## 3
I'm not too sure that all this transposing and stuff was necessary

## 8
The stuff with sets might be replaced by bitshifting

## !!! 12 !!!
This was naive and inefficient, there's bound to be a better way.

## !!! 15 !!!
Part 2 is inefficient due to the looping for incrementing, there's got to be a better way, something with whole division and modulo and what not
Would be nice: Visualize actual path finding
